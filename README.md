# X32 Toolkit

## Usecases

This toolkit was designed for sessions with near-identical routing/patching needs in mind. Going from any number of X32.scn files and LOGIC.logicx files as a base (think 1 for FoH, 1 for the Monitor desk, 1 logic project for multitrack recording), the Toolkit will create Scenes and Projects for every Session, renaming channels everywhere.

X32_Toolkit can also help you move channels around in a regular Scene, preserving input routing for a specific channel name (the channel Drag-and-Drop the X32 really misses :)
